 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

 <hr/>

 <h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
 <p>I like The Pursuit of Happyness because it shows the power of never giving up, no matter how hard life gets. The story of Chris Gardner is incredibly inspiring—he faces so many challenges, including poverty, homelessness, and raising a son on his own, but he never loses hope or stops working hard. It teaches me that success doesn’t come easily, but with determination, love for family, and belief in yourself, anything is possible. The movie reminds me to be grateful and to keep moving forward, even when life feels unfair. </p>

 <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
 <p>I like 3 Idiots because it teaches valuable life lessons in an entertaining and emotional way. The movie shows that true success comes from following your passion, not just chasing grades or degrees. I especially admire the character Rancho, who encourages his friends to think differently, ask questions, and love what they do. The story highlights the pressure students face and how the education system sometimes forgets the importance of creativity and real understanding. It made me laugh, cry, and think deeply about my own goals and values. That’s why it’s one of my favorite movies.</p>

 <h3>Salam New-York</h3>
 <p>I like Salam New-York because it’s a fun and inspiring story about chasing your dreams in a new country. The main character's journey from Kyrgyzstan to New York shows how difficult but exciting it can be to start over and follow your passion. I enjoyed the mix of humor, culture, and emotional moments, especially how he stays true to his roots while adjusting to a different lifestyle. The movie also made me think about identity, ambition, and how important it is to believe in yourself even when others don’t. It’s a feel-good film with a strong message.</p>
